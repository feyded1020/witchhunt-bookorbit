// Cache-at-rest cipher for protected books — docs/protected-content-plan.md §2 (RULE P2)
// and §3 (Phase 0).
//
// A book read under LCP or Adobe DRM must not leave its plaintext on the SD card, but the
// reader's whole page-turn path is built on cached derivatives of that plaintext (the
// extracted XHTML, the laid-out pages, the converted images). This enciphers those files at
// rest so the card holds no readable copy, without changing a single byte offset in any of
// the formats that reference them.
//
// ChaCha20 (RFC 8439) as a pure keystream:
//
//   * **Length-preserving.** Ciphertext is exactly as long as plaintext, so every stored
//     offset — the page LUT, the patched section header, the anchor and page-break maps —
//     stays valid and no format changes.
//   * **Offset-addressable.** apply() derives the keystream position from the absolute file
//     offset, so a page turn deciphers only the page record it actually reads (a few KB)
//     rather than everything before it. A CBC-style mode would force a read from byte zero.
//   * **Cheap in software.** Our wolfSSL build has no hardware crypto (the Espressif port is
//     gated on WOLFSSL_ESPIDF, which never turns on under Arduino), and the accelerator would
//     not help here anyway: its single-block entry point takes a mutex and reloads the key per
//     16 bytes. See the plan §2.4.
//
// Symmetric: apply() enciphers and deciphers. Freestanding C++17 — no Arduino, no allocation,
// no file knowledge — so it is exercised by test/cache_cipher against the RFC vectors.
//
// NOT the same thing as lib/Serialization/ObfuscationUtils, which XORs short credential
// strings with the 6-byte hardware MAC. That is casual-read protection for a handful of
// bytes; against kilobytes of known-structure book text it is not protection at all. Do not
// merge the two.
//
// **Contract the caller owns:** a (key, nonce) pair must never encipher two different
// plaintexts. Reusing one across two files, or across two generations of the same file, lets
// anyone holding both ciphertexts recover their XOR. Deriving a distinct nonce per cache file
// is the key-management layer's job, not this class's.

// Backend selection. On device wolfSSL's ChaCha20 does the work — it is already linked for
// TLS, and it measured 2.5x the throughput of the portable core (see CacheCipher.cpp). The
// portable core is what the host tests exercise, since wolfSSL is not built by that
// toolchain. Both are pinned to the same RFC 8439 vectors.
