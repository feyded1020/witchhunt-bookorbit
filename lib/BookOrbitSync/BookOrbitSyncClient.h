 * HTTP client for BookOrbit's KOReader-compatible sync API.
 *
 * BookOrbit exposes the same kosync wire protocol as a plain koreader-sync
 * server (same request/response shapes, same x-auth-user/x-auth-key headers,
 * same userkey = MD5(password)), just mounted under an API prefix instead of
 * the root. We reuse KOReaderProgress since the wire format is identical.
 *
 * Base URL: BookOrbitCredentialStore::getBaseUrl(), e.g.
 *   https://books.example.com/api/v1/koreader
 *
 * API Endpoints:
 *   GET /users/auth - Authenticate (validate credentials)
 *   GET /syncs/progress/:document - Get progress for a document
 *   PUT /syncs/progress - Update progress for a document
 *
 * Authentication:
 *   x-auth-user: username
 *   x-auth-key: MD5 hash of password
 *
 * Document identity: BookOrbit only supports the binary partial-MD5 document
 * hash (see KOReaderDocumentId::calculate), unlike plain koreader-sync servers
 * which can also be configured to match by filename.
