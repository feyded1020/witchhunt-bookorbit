/**
 * One per-page reading event queued for upload to BookOrbit's page-stats endpoint,
 * matching what BookOrbit's own KOReader plugin sends (the server clusters raw page
 * events into reading sessions, which power its time/streak/pace/reading-DNA stats).
 *
 * CrossPoint page numbers are per-chapter and layout-dependent, so events store the
 * overall book position in basis points instead: page N of totalPages=10000, so
 * page/totalPages reproduces the exact reading fraction on any device.
 *
 * `era`/`flags` exist because the X4 has no battery-backed RTC: events recorded
 * before the clock was NTP-confirmed carry CLOCK_APPROXIMATE and the WallClock power
 * era they were stamped in. Same-era events are corrected to exact time at upload
 * (see BookOrbitSyncActivity::uploadQueuedStats); older-era events upload with their
 * checkpoint-approximate stamps.
